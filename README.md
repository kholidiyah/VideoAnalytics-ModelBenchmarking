# VideoAnalytics-ModelBenchmarking

## Description
This repository contains datasets, scripts, and results for the paper:
**"Performance Comparison of Object Detection Models for Video Analytics Under Varying Video Quality"**.

The repository includes:
- **Video datasets** in three quality categories (High, Medium, Low)
- **Ground truth annotations** in COCO-compatible format
- **FFmpeg encoding scripts** to reproduce video quality variations
- **Inference scripts** for Fast R-CNN, EfficientDet, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and DETR
- **Evaluation scripts** to compute Bitrate (Mbps), PSNR (dB), and Accuracy
